description: Create concise, dataset-agnostic physical state plans from video prompts. Use when Codex needs to decompose a prompt, optional physical hints, or optional evaluation questions into scene objects, semantic keyframes, transitions, causal constraints, must-show requirements, and must-avoid failures before any video, Blender, simulation, or animation implementation.

# Physical State Planner

## Purpose

Use this skill to turn a video prompt into a lightweight physical process plan.
The output is an implementation-neutral sequence of semantic keyframes and
transitions for later Coder, Blender, simulation, or audit agents.

Do not write Blender code, implementation primitives, solver settings, render
commands, or exact frame numbers.

## Inputs

Accept these fields when available:

- `prompt` required: the video description.
- `physics_hints` optional: physical laws, category labels, domain notes.
- `eval_hints` optional: questions, middle-frame requirements, final-frame checks.
- `dataset_metadata` optional: dataset name, category, subcategory, index.

If a field is missing, continue from the prompt and record needed assumptions.

## Workflow

1. Extract the core physical event from the prompt:
   - transfer, heating, cooling, melting, boiling, freezing, mixing, dissolving,
     reacting, burning, breaking, colliding, deforming, falling, floating,
     spreading, separating, or settling.

2. Identify scene objects:
   - `initial_objects`: visible before the event begins.
   - `process_objects`: visible only after the trigger or during evolution.
   - `final_objects_or_states`: final products, layers, colors, damage,
     deformation, phase state, or arrangement.

3. Create semantic keyframes:
   - Use 4-5 keyframes by default: `K0` initial, `K1` onset, `K2` middle
     process, optional `K3` late process, `K4` final.
   - Use 4 keyframes for simple events and 5 keyframes for most material or
     physical transformations. Use 6 only when a distinct intermediate state is
     physically necessary. Do not exceed 6 keyframes.
   - Use `time_hint` as a rough percentage such as `0%`, `20%`, `50%`, `75%`,
     and `100%`; do not choose exact implementation frames.
   - For each keyframe, describe the visible state, the physical state, and
     what must not be visible yet.
   - Make neighboring keyframes visibly distinct. Do not put the same change
     in both onset and middle keyframes.

4. Create transitions between keyframes:
   - For every adjacent pair, state the cause and the continuous change.
   - Include `should_not_jump` items that would make the transition look
     discontinuous or physically uncaused.
   - Describe where the effect originates when relevant, such as heat source,
     contact boundary, impact point, liquid source, reaction interface, or
     applied force.
   - Make each transition answer these questions when applicable:
     `origin`: where does the visible change start?
     `direction`: where does it move, spread, shrink, rise, fall, or propagate?
     `material_source`: where does the new visible material, color, phase, or
     damage come from?
     `continuity`: what visible quantity should change smoothly instead of
     jumping?
   - Avoid generic transition text such as "the object gradually changes" unless
     it names the origin, direction, and visible continuous change.

5. Write lightweight causal constraints:
   - Use simple before/after constraints.
   - Focus on preventing result states from appearing before their causes.
   - Include contact-before-reaction, heat-before-phase-change,
     accumulation-before-final-layer, force-before-deformation, or
     trigger-before-damage when relevant.

6. Extract visual requirements:
   - `must_show`: prompt-critical objects, intermediate states from eval hints,
     and final outcomes.
   - `must_avoid`: likely failure modes such as premature result appearance,
     missing contact, sudden geometric products, homogeneous mixing when
     separation is required, or wrong final arrangement.

7. Record uncertain assumptions:
   - Mark assumptions that are needed to plan the physics but are not explicit
     in the input.
   - Do not present assumptions as confirmed facts.

## Planning Rules

- Keep the plan short enough for downstream agents to follow.
- Prefer 4-5 semantic keyframes; use 6 only for genuinely complex physical
  processes.
- Prefer physical states over visual tricks.
- Do not decide implementation primitives such as sphere, cylinder, mesh,
  shader, particle system, or keyframe timing.
- Do not overfit to one dataset's field names.
- Treat evaluation hints as ordering or visibility hints when present, but keep
  the schema dataset-agnostic.
- A final state may be visually simple, but its prerequisites must appear in
  either `transitions` or `causal_constraints`.
- The transition text should be directly usable by a Coder agent and directly
  auditable from extracted preview frames.
- A transition is incomplete if it does not say where the effect starts or how
  it remains visually connected to the previous keyframe.

## Anti-Patterns To Catch

Include likely anti-patterns in `must_avoid` or transition `should_not_jump`:

- Result appears before trigger.
- Contact/reaction/color change happens before contact.
- Phase change appears before heating or cooling.
- Final layer, pool, crack, flame, bubble, stain, or product appears suddenly.
- Motion reads as a rigid geometric symbol when the prompt implies a material
  process.
- The final frame is correct but the middle process is physically missing.
- An effect appears far from its physical origin without a connecting path.
